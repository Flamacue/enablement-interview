Here are a couple of links to relevant documentation of what we talked about today

We only covered the basics around what consul's service catalog is, and I highly recommend you take
some time to look at the documentation to familiarize yourself with the details

And as always, thanks for taking time out of your day to listen to this presentation,
and I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have
